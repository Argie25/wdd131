                <h2>Cockatiel Care</h2>
                <p>Caring for a cockatiel involves providing a spacious, safe cage with appropriate bar spacing and a variety of perches and toys. Their diet should primarily consist of balanced pellets, supplemented with seeds and fresh vegetables and fruits, while avoiding toxic foods. Regular veterinary check-ups, proper grooming, and maintaining a clean environment are crucial for their health. Cockatiels require daily social interaction, mental stimulation through training and play, and supervised out-of-cage exercise. Understanding their body language and communication, and ensuring a safe, hazard-free environment, are essential to keeping them healthy and happy.</p>

                <h2>Behavior and Training</h2>
                <p>Cockatiels are social and expressive birds that communicate through vocalizations and body language, such as raised crests for excitement and flat crests for fear. They thrive on daily interaction and can mimic sounds or learn to whistle tunes. Positive reinforcement, using treats and praise, is effective for training, starting with basic commands like "step up" and progressing to tricks like spinning or fetching. Regular, gentle handling builds trust, while addressing behavioral issues involves identifying triggers and redirecting actions without punishment. Providing varied toys and consistent, positive interactions ensures a well-behaved, happy cockatiel.</p>

                <p>
                    Maintaining a cockatiel's health and wellness involves regular veterinary check-ups, proper grooming, and a clean living environment. Ensure a balanced diet primarily of pellets, supplemented with seeds, fresh vegetables, and fruits, while avoiding toxic foods like avocado and chocolate. Regularly trim their nails and provide cuttlebones for beak health. Clean the cage, perches, and toys frequently to prevent bacterial growth. Monitor for signs of illness, such as changes in appetite, droppings, or behavior, and consult an avian vet if needed. Adequate exercise, mental stimulation, and social interaction are also essential for their overall well-being.</p>

                <h2>Fun Facts and Interesting Tidbits</h2>
                <p>Cockatiels are fascinating birds known for their crest, which can indicate their mood; a raised crest often signals excitement, while a flat crest can denote fear. They are talented mimics, capable of learning to whistle tunes and imitate sounds, sometimes even learning to speak a few words. Native to Australia, cockatiels are the smallest members of the cockatoo family. They have a lifespan of 15-20 years with proper care, sometimes even longer. Cockatiels enjoy chewing and need plenty of toys to keep them entertained and mentally stimulated. Additionally, they form strong bonds with their human caregivers and other birds, making them affectionate and loyal pets.</p>
